# 🌾 Kissan Sathi - Blockchain Farming App Updates

## 📋 Summary of Changes

I've updated your blockchain farming application to match your smart contract changes and added new features. Here's what has been done:

---

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. **Smart Contract Integration Updates**

#### Price System Changed: INR → Wei (ETH)
- Your smart contract now uses **Wei** (smallest unit of Ethereum) instead of INR
- All JavaScript files updated to handle Wei correctly
- Price inputs now accept ETH values (e.g., 0.001 ETH)
- Display prices in ETH format throughout the app

#### Updated Contract ABI
- Fixed function signatures to match your new smart contract
- Added missing functions: `getProduceIdsByName`, `nextProduceId`
- Updated events: `PriceUpdated`, `StatusUpdated`
- Added `registrationTimestamp` field to produce details

---

### 2. **New Pages Created**

#### 🛒 **Marketplace Page** (`marketplace.html` + `marketplace.js`)
**Features:**
- Browse all available products in a beautiful grid layout
- Search by product name, ID, or farm origin
- Filter by status (Available/Sold)
- **Shopping Cart functionality**:
  - Add multiple items to cart
  - View cart with total price
  - Remove individual items
  - Bulk checkout (purchase all at once)
  - Cart persists in localStorage
- Real-time product status display
- Direct links to product details
- Responsive design for mobile devices

**How it works:**
- Connects to blockchain to fetch all products
- Uses `nextProduceId()` to know how many products exist
- Loops through all products and displays them

2. **Update CONTRACT_ADDRESS** in these files:
   - `farmer.js` (line 16)
   - `customer.js` (line 8)
   - `marketplace.js` (line 24)
   - `profile.js` (line 17)
   
   Replace `'0x...'` with your actual deployed contract address.

3. **Install MetaMask** browser extension

4. **Connect to the correct network** (same network where contract is deployed)

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### Price Format
- Your contract stores prices in **Wei** (1 ETH = 10^18 Wei)
- Users input prices in **ETH** (e.g., 0.001 ETH)
- JavaScript automatically converts: `ethers.parseEther()` for input, `ethers.formatEther()` for display

### Contract Address
- **CRITICAL**: Update the CONTRACT_ADDRESS in all JS files
- All files currently have `'0x...'` placeholder
- Must be the same address in all files

### Network
- Make sure MetaMask is on the **same network** as your deployed contract
- Testnet recommended for development (Sepolia, Goerli)
- Mainnet only for production (costs real ETH)

### Gas Fees
- All blockchain transactions require gas fees
- Users pay gas in ETH when:
  - Registering produce
  - Updating price/status
  - Purchasing products
- Read operations (viewing data) are free

---

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark mode design
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Animations**: Smooth hover effects and transitions
- **Color-coded Status**: Green for available, Red for sold
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during blockchain operations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Please install MetaMask"
- Install MetaMask browser extension
- Reload the page

### "Please connect your wallet first"
- Click "Connect Wallet" button
- Approve connection in MetaMask

### "Failed to load products"
- Check CONTRACT_ADDRESS is correct
- Verify you're on the correct network
- Make sure contract is deployed

### Prices showing as very large numbers
- This means Wei conversion is missing
- Prices should be converted with `ethers.formatEther()`

### Transaction failed
- Check you have enough ETH for gas fees
- Verify you have enough ETH for the purchase price
- Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask
