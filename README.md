##  Overview
Kissan Sathi is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to empower farmers by leveraging blockchain technology. It aims to eliminate middlemen, ensure fair pricing, and provide a transparent supply chain for agricultural produce. By recording transactions on an immutable ledger, the platform fosters trust between farmers and buyers.

##  Key Features
- **Decentralized Marketplace:** Direct connection between farmers and buyers.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated agreements for payments and delivery conditions.
- **Supply Chain Transparency:** Track produce from farm to table.
- **Secure Identity:** Blockchain-based verification for users.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Polygon / Hyperledger
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express
- **Database:** MongoDB / IPFS (for file storage)
- **Tools:** Truffle / Hardhat, MetaMask

##  Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MetaMask browser extension
- Ganache (for local blockchain testing)

### Backend / Smart Contracts Setup
1. Navigate to the blockchain directory:
   ```bash
   cd blockchain
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
4. Deploy to local network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (create a `.env` file):
   ```env
   REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
   ```

##  How to Run
1. Start the local blockchain node (if using Hardhat/Ganache).
2. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and connect MetaMask to the local network.
